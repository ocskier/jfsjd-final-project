## Walkthrough

### Step 0: Create a private GitHub repository
Create a private GitHub repository that is shared among your groupmates and your instructor.

### Step 1: Create the page structure

In this step, we'll create a basic HTML structure and include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

1. Create a new file called `about.html` in your project folder.
2. Create a new file called `styles.css` and put this file inside a folder called `css` in your project folder.
3. Include your `styles.css` file inside the `about.html` page. (Hint: If you need a reminder - look up how to include css files in html files.)
3. Create a new Github repo and add, commit and push your files.

### Step 2: Implementing your About page

Go through the different [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/alerts/) and select the ones that are similar 
to your wireframes structure created on Task 1.
