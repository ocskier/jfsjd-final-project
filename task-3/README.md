## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Implement the home page

In this step, we'll create a basic HTML structure for the home page which includes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

1. Create a new file called `index.html` inside your project folder.
2. Include your `styles.css` file inside the `index.html` page.
3. Add a short description, image, video or any other element you like to explain what your project does.
4. Add your new files to the Github repo, commit and push your changes.

### Step 2: Implementing your Items List page

1. Create a new file depending on the project you are implementing: 
    * `products.html`
    * `posts.html`
2. Include your `styles.css` file inside your html page.
3. Create a sample list with some sample data to see how your items list will look like

2. Add a Navbar with the menu options for each page
    * Home
    * About Us
    * Items List
    * Model Form
3. Add a link to each menu item so it redirects to expected html page.
